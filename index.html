        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught developer who started down this path in the fall of 2019,
          after I moved to Amsterdam from San Francisco. I love learning new things, so I
          started learning Dutch and (re-learning) programming at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I spent a decade working as strategist and product manager for
          agencies, consultancies and startups in the UK and USA. I enjoy remote work with
          other self-motivated people, building practical and understated things, and
          short feedback loops.

        <h3>Previous work</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          In my last role before the switch, I was a PM for a
          <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com" target="_blank">QA testing startup</a>,
          where I led a remote team working on the technology and community at the heart
          of the app. I'm proud to have made the platform more reliable for teams who
          depended on us, reducing quality-related churn to less than 2% of our ARR. I'm
          even prouder of the positive impact we had on thousands of people around the
          world who improved their lives with money earned through our platform.
        </p>

        <h3>Outside work</h3>
        <p>
          When not working I can be found

            >reading</a
          >, in a hot yoga class, or thinking about things like, how technology can change
          our lives for the better, and how to feel happy and succesful when collaborating
          remotely.

        it helps deepen my knowledge of various language aspects.
