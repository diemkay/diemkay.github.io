        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught developer who started down this path in the fall of 2019,
          after I moved to Amsterdam from San Francisco. I love learning new things, so I
          started learning Dutch and programmingâ€”an old passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously, I spent a decade as product manager and strategist for startups,
          agencies and consultancies in the UK and USA. I like remote work, building
          things, short feedback loops, taking in lots of information and discovering
          connections and underlying structures between things.
        </p>

        <h3>Previous work</h3>

        <p>
          In my last role before the switch, I was a PM for a
          <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com" target="_blank">QA testing startup</a>,
          where I led a remote team working on the technology and community at the heart
          of the app. I'm proud to have made the platform more reliable for teams who
          depended on us, reducing quality-related churn to less than 2% of our ARR. I'm
          even prouder of the positive impact we had on thousands of people around the
          world who improved their lives with money they earned testing for us.
        </p>

        <h3>Outside work</h3>
        <p>
          When not working I can be found
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4080999-andreea" target="_blank"
            >reading</a
          >, in a hot yoga class, or thinking about things like sustainable living or what
          makes people and teams successful. I also practice on
          <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/diemkay" target="_blank">CodeWars</a> to
          deepen my knowledge of various language aspects.
