      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a self-taught developer who started down this path in the fall of
        2019, after I moved to Amsterdam from San Francisco. I love learning new
        things, so I leaned into an old passion from high school: programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        My strenghts come from over a decade as strategist and product manager
        in startups and digital agencies in the UK and USA. I've built strong
        relationships within and across teams, managed complex apps in the
        context of modern software development lifecycle, and delivered great
        user experiences to global audiences.
      </p>

      <h3>â†’ Previous work</h3>

      <p>
        In my last role before the switch, I was a PM for a
        <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com">QA testing startup</a>, where I
        led a distributed squad working on the technology and community at the
        heart of the app. I'm proud to have played a key role in improving
        results, reducing associated churn to under 2% of our ARR, and equally
        proud of the positive impact we had on thousands of people around the
        world who earned money through us.
      </p>

      <h3>â†’ Outside work</h3>
      When not working I can be found
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4080999-andreea">reading</a>,
      in a hot yoga class, or thinking about things like sustainable living or
      what makes people and teams successful. I also practice on
      <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/diemkay">CodeWars</a> to deepen my
      knowledge of various language aspects.
