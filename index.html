        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> I'm a self-taught developer who switched over after over a decade in strategy and
          product management. I work with React, Javascript, and serverless apps. Outside of code,
          I've lived in five countries by accident, rather than by design. When not working I can be
          found reading, writing, watching documentaris, in a hot yoga class (pre-pandemic), or
          daydreaming about life in the countryside. </p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p> These are things I wrote as journal entries; random thoughts and feelings about a single
          topic, with a vague sense of 'past me' or family members as the audience, like when I help
          my brother or sister work through challenges. </p>
