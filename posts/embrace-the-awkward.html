      <p class="subtitle">Abandon small talk</p>

        <p>
          This week, I read a <a href="https://twitter.com/reinpk/status/1483476822897668099?s=20" target="_blank">great
            Twitter thread</a> by the previous CEO of Segment, an analytics software company. He briefly
          described being against hiring a salesperson he didn't think would be a good cultural fit with the engineering
          managers
          he'd have to interact with. But, alas, he was proven dead wrong over the years. Surdi, the sales manager, did
          a
          stellar job
          and exceeded his expectations. The key to his success? He cut to the chase and asked customers questions that
          made
          them feel awkward
          and uncomfortable but yielded treasure troves of insights for the company.

          <span class="newthought">When the world zigs, zag.</span>
          Where other salespeople got customers used to being talked at about a product, Segment took the
          opposite,
          dialectic approach. The safe, <em>"tell me what you think about the product,"</em> questions were replaced by
          the earnest,
          <em>"Why did you have us here
            today?"</em> or <em>"Why don't you just build Segment yourself?"</em>. Bolstered by success, the question
          got even bolder: <em>"Who's the
            ultimate economic decision maker on this? You?"</em>. Frankly, they were right to do so, especially with
          companies with labyrinthine sets of stakeholders and politics that would waste their time.

        <p>Cut to the chase. Most meetings suck: they're unclear about their purpose and go on for too long because
          everyone is usually too afraid to be the one to cancel. Even researchers think they're <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-50418317" target="_blank">a form of therapy</a> for cogs who don't
          understand their purpose in the machine, and need to reassert it or reassure themselves their work still
          matters. And small talk sucks too, in all relationships. But we stretch out chats about the weather, travel,
          education, commutes, and the price of things when we could establish a real connection with someone.</p>
        <p>Why canâ€™t we replace small talk with big talk? Why not ask about what really matters right from the start?
          Why
          talk
          about commutes, when you can talk about dreams, beliefs, hopes, and fears? It shouldn't be that hard to ditch
          the habit, but it
          is. What's the worst that can happen? At best, you'll have a great experience. At worst, some funny story to
          tell
          later. Embrace the awkard: silence or questions.</p>
