            than respect. Hatred is more durable than judgement. The driving force behind most great
            social/political changes is not scientific knowledge but a mythos-driven fanaticism that

        <p>This post was a breath of fresh air in my feed, which is usually filled with
          techno-optimists who tend to believe that facts change people's minds, or call forth some
          semblance of reason in others. Unfortunately, much as I'd like to, they don't. Combined
          with the fact that we're all inhabiting our own realities and bubbles, facts are now mere
          opinions, rather than ways of describing or talking about reality for some people.</p>
        <p>If there's one thing I am grateful for, it's to have had a stint around advertising and
          marketing before fully becoming a product manager and engineer. One of the most useful
          lessons it can teach (apart from the fact that it's healthier to assume that nobody cares
          about your product or message) is that in most cases, you should try really hard to make
          people <em>feel</em> something. Stories, rather than facts tend to make people feel
          things, especially when their or their group identity is called into question.</p>
