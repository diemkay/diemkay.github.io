      <p class="subtitle">How to distill your thoughts</p>
      <section>
        <p><span class="newthought">Once commuting on a train</span>, I sat next to someone working
          hard on a presentation; they were 72 slides in, editing a slide covered entirely in text
          in 10p font. Sadly, this slide was no exception, and I felt for the poor soul doomed to
          experience it.</p>

        <h2>Why can't we be brief?</h2>
        <blockquote>

                rel="noopener noreferrer">Lettres Provinciales</a>, the French philosopher and
              mathematician Blaise Pascal famously wrote: “I would have written a shorter letter,
              but I did not have the time.”</i>

          <p>
            <i>This sentiment […] reflects both the value and the challenges of brevity. On the one
              hand, brevity forces us to cut excess — to distill a message to its core. On the other
              hand, being accurate, clear, and concise can be hard, sometimes impossibly so.”</i>

        <p>In my experience at work, people will forgive many things, even thick accents that some
          people feel self-conscious about, or grammatical errors. But glaring communication
          mistakes, like talking too much and not getting to the point, are hard to overlook and can
          have a lasting impact.</p>
        <p>Communication is fundamental to getting any work done, and being bad at it hurts your
          prospects and relationships. If you say too much and rarely (or never) get to the point,
          people will start to think you&apos;re insincere, ineffective, or, worse — incompetent.
        </p>
        <p>But the opposite is also true: if you organize and distill your thoughts, get your point
          across, and respect the other person&apos;s intelligence and time, you&apos;ll appear
          competent and self-assured.</p>

        <h2>School teaches the wrong things</h2>
        <p> I struggled, you struggle, we all struggle (at first). Communicating clearly at work is
          almost the opposite what we normally do, so it's natural to be bad if no one tells you how
          to do it.</p>
        <p>We should learn how to communicate clearly in school, but education tends to incentivize
          fluff over substance. When assignments prioritize word counts or talking time, most
          students will think <em>"great, how do I add more padding to hit the number?"</em></p>
        <p>School is where we pick up bad habits like adding everything we researched to show we
          weren't lazy, pompous synonyms, filler text, setting strange values on document margins,
          font sizes, etc. that distract from the main point.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Is this you?</h2>
        <p>Think about recent conversations you've had at work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Did people ask you questions about things you thought were obvious?</li>
          <li>Ever forgot what you intended to say or realize you ended up talking about something
            tangential for a long time?</li>
          <li>Ever left conversations only to realize you didn't get the information you needed from
            the other person?</li>
          <li>Do your meetings frequently overrun?</li>
          <li>And the obvious: did someone ever interrupt you and point-blank told you to get to the
            point?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the answers are yes, or you feel flustered just thinking about this list, then you
          have some challenges to address. I answered yes to most of these things fresh out of
          university.</p>
        <p> So relax; this doesn't mean you're fundamentally flawed. Getting better is a journey. If
          you only take away one thing, it's this: clear communication is a sign of mutual respect.

        <h2>Three practices for how to distill your thoughts</h2>
        <h3>Practice empathy for the audience</h3>
        <p> Empathy is a muscle that needs to be exercised at every opportunity until it becomes
          natural. Before sharing information, ask yourself:
        <ul>
          <li>What does this person need to know?</li>
          <li>What did they know before?</li>
          <li>What will they do with the information?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Use a framework</h3>
        <p>Frameworks save you time because someone else faced the same challenges and solved them
          before.</p>
        <p>Try a concept called <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516">the
            pyramid principle</a> or the Minto principle. One of McKinsey's first female business
          analysts, Barbara Minto, came up with this principle. She and her team had a reputation
          for clear and effective communication, which is essential for consultants presenting
          months of work to executives who need to make high impact decisions.</p>
        <p>The pyramid principle is a covered in a dedicated book. Its core idea is that ideas in
          writing should always form a pyramid under a single thought:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the bottom are the raw insights and data points you've collected and analyzed.
            You've done the work, and all this detail will be useful to know, document, and refer
            to, but will never be communicated fully to others.</li>
          <li>In the middle are the main conclusions you can draw from the data. These form the
            pillars for your key take-away or recommendation.</li>
          <li>At the top of the pyramid is your main point: a punchy statement or recommendation
            informed by your intermediary conclusions. If you only have time to say one thing about
            your work, this must be it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, ideas at any level in the pyramid always summarize those below. </p>
        <p>Great communicators start from the top, and go into more detail as needed. For example,
          in an interview, you can start with a direct answer to a question, and check if the
          interviewer if they want to know more. If they do, you can drill deeper into a few points
          that inform your reasoning (the middle of the pyramid). If they're <em>particularly</em>
          keen to test your knowledge, you can go even deeper and quote a stat or data point (bottom
          of the pyramid) you're aware of.</p>
        <h3>When in doubt, less is more</h3>
        <p>Another way to get to the point is to cut out the noise from your life and work. When
          you're less concerned or distracted by too many topics, you gain precious time to hone
          those you really care about. </p>
        <p>It's up to you to figure out what's noise; my take is that anything not directly
          relevant to your immediate life or work goals is noise. You probably don't need to be
          informed about many things in your inbox or social feed. And you probably don't need to
          have opinions on just as many things. If anyone holds that against you, their opinion may
          be noise too.</p>
