        <p>Are you a new developer? Do you ever feel guilty for not having an online presence full
          of technical content, where you try to explain what you've learned? Do you get the sense
          that you'll never have a successful career if you don't? Or that you're missing out on
          being part of a community of developers and content creators learning in public? </p>
        <p>My unorthodox opinion as a career switcher: don't be.</p>

        <h2>You might be a dark matter developer</h2>
        <p>In the last decade or so, there’s been a sometimes not-so-subtle trend towards pushing
          developers to have more of a presence online. Some prominent voices in the developer
          community encourage newcomers to do at least one of the following:
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <i>"[W]rite demos, blogs, tutorials and cheatsheets, speak at meetups and conferences,
              ask and answer questions on Stack Overflow or Reddit, make YouTube videos or Twitch
              streams, start a newsletter, draw cartoons (people love cartoons)”</i>
          <footer> swyx, “The Coding Career Handbook” </footer>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>There's an implication that if you don't create technical content alongside your
          professional development trajectory, you may be one of those mysterious “<a
            href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99"
            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollower">dark matter developers</a>”: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <i>"They don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user
              groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large
              conferences. Where are these dark matter developers online?”</i>
          <footer> Scott Hanselman, “Dark Matter Developers: The Unseen 99%” </footer>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Scott has in mind the mysterious C++ and .NET developers happy with their lot, using
          tried-and-tested technologies, while swyx and others target newcomers, i.e., developers
          who started in the last five years (after 2017). But the FOMO message that you could be
          <i>one of those people</i> who doesn't exist unless they create technical content exhaust
          hits just the same.</p>

        <h2>The learning-to-code content landscape</h2>
        <p>On the surface, it seems well-intentioned to give new developers a new path to advance
          their careers or increase their earning potential.</p>
        <p>But, as someone who learned how to code in the last five years, I can testify to the
          existence of a well-documented glut of beginner content. This corpse-laden hill called
          "learning to code" tutorials looks more or less like:
        <ul>
          <li>A few good or great people at the top, who first became technically good, then started
            to create content and share their expertise; </li>
          <li>Many obvious charlatans who prey on the hopes and dreams of aspiring developers;</li>
          <li>A glut beginners creating incomplete, often barely proofread articles or unstructured
            video tutorials, that rarely get updated or corrected.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Excluding charlatans, this is a new phenomenon: beginners without technical expertise or
          mastery of a domain are encouraged to create content for attention and credibility, to
          discriminate themselves in a competitive world.</p>
        <p>But this both pointless and demoralizing.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why I don't create technical content</h2>
        <p>The main reason is that I lack the technical expertise to do so. True mastery of a field
          takes a long time, and I've barely scratched the surface at time of writing.</p>
        <p> It's not for fear of being online (though, for some people, being harassed would be a
          good reason to not write). I've been writing online under my name since 2003, and also
          wrote on behalf of companies I worked for. It also boils down to not wasting the reader's
          time, or my time:</p>
        <h3>If it doesn't add something new, it probably adds to the noise</h3>
        <p>Human knowledge grows when you create something new or combine existing information in
          novel ways. Without mastery in the field, it's unlikely I'll achieve either.</p>
        <p>Until then, I do have unique insights into the challenges I faced. Arguably that might be
          more interesting than any technical content I could create at this stage. </p>
        <p>Adding another <i>How to iterate over an array in JavaScript</i> tutorial could end up
          being annoyingly incomplete, or damaging for someone else. After years of public-facing
          writing, I feel a sense of responsibility for the content I put out. So it seems
          detrimental to leave technically inaccurate or incomplete information out for others to
          stumble upon.</p>
        <!------------------------->
        <h3>Being a content creator is a ton of work</h3>
        <p>Follow enough of them online and you will know it's almost a full-time job. I don't even
          see that many senior developers who have time to do it consistently, unless their job or
          career aspirations require (or demand) it.</p>
        <p>New developers already have so much to learn and catch up with. Piling on the expectation
          that you need to <i>also</i> create technical content to get ahead, on top of the bleak
          leetcode-style grind that many people pursue, is soul-crushing and unnecessary. </p>
        <p><span class="marginnote">Recommended: <a
              href="https://benadam.me/thoughts/great-to-good/" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">"Struggling to believe greatness is worth it"</a></span>It
          also stinks of the toxic and discriminatory "publish or perish" mentality seen in
          academia. So why bring a nascent form of this to programming? There's still room for
          everyone here, including people whose personalities put aren't in the
          <i>loud-online-pushing-things-forward 1%</i>, as Scott honestly describes himself?</p>

        <h2>What I write instead</h2>
        <p>These alternatives might inspire you too, and could also help you publish one day:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A developer diary, or devlog. I write a document for every complex feature or bug I
            work on that challenges me. I outline what I know, what my approach will be, and later
            reflect on how it all went down. It's not very sophisticated, and it has become a
            reliable problem-solving flow that works for me. The reflection often proves to be the
            most valuable - what often challenges me is the emotional, rather than the technical
            part. </li>
          <li>A personal knowledge store. Because I learned to code by myself, it would take me
            dozens of articles or videos to understand a concept, or help distinguish facts from
            opinions. I ended up creating Notion pages as 'personal documentation' for the
            technologies I use. In them, I mostly explain things in my own words, often going back
            to add more sophisticated explanations as my knowledge deepens. When I manipulate
            information in this way, I retain it much better.</li>
          <li>Write opinions, or about unique experiences (like this post). While I don't have any
            mastery or technical expertise to speak of, it might still be valuable to share what I
            know, in the hope that it helps someone. People who people buy the benefit of what you
            do, and, increasingly, the <i>why</i> behind what you’re doing. In a world where few
            developers </li>
        </ol>

        <p>I'll end on this fitting quote from Henri Matisse, who started making collages from paper
          cutouts when he became too frail to paint large canvases, but not too frail to learn
          something new.</p>
